“How sustainable is the pace of Urbanisation & Net land usage?” scoped on two geographical locations.
a)      Bellandur & Varthur Lake (Bengaluru, India)
b)     Baner Gaon (Pune, India)

From a college student to a professional, Over the last 2 decades I have personally experienced the rapid pace of Urbanisation in the city of Pune and Bengaluru.
Bengaluru, we once knew was city of lakes and both these cities are known for its pleasant weather.
....................................................................................................................

Applied the concept of Image segmentation on satellite images of these locations over the time period of last 2 decades.

Bengaluru (Bellandur & Varthur Lake):
..............................................................................
Over the last 2 decades we can see the impact of urbanisation on these lakes. There have been much required advances in the initiatives and laws towards reinstating Bengaluru’s biodiversity recently, hoping to see the benefits in the coming years.

Baner Gaon (Pune):
........................................
Over the last few years Baner has seen initiatives by Individuals, NGO’s and corporates towards Afforestation and reinstating the biodiversity. The result is that with the increased urbanisation Baner has invested in its green cover primarily in the last few years. The result is visible in the images.


While large institutions and governments will play key role through public private partnerships in climate change adaptation and mitigation, we as individuals can be the catalyst to this required shift by ensuring that our consumption patterns and social behaviours are not at the cost of this planet’s ecosystem
